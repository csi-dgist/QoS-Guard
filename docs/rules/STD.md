# Stage 1 & 2: Standard (STD) Rules

This page describes the QoS dependency and consistency rules derived from the **OMG DDS** and **ROS 2 Standard** specifications. Violation of these rules typically results in entity creation failure or immediate communication incompatibility.

---

## ## 🏗️ Structural Consistency (Stage 1)
*Focuses on individual entity (Publisher or Subscriber) settings and internal consistency.*

| No. | Identifier | QoS Conflict Condition (Violation) | Dependency | Entity | Basis |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | HIST ↔ RESLIM | $[HIST.kind = KEEP\_LAST] \wedge [HIST.depth > mpi]$ | Structural | Pub, Sub | STD |
| 2 | RESLIM ↔ RESLIM | $[max\_samples < max\_samples\_per\_instance]$ | Structural | Pub, Sub | STD |

## 🤝 RxO Compatibility (Stage 2)
*Focuses on the compatibility between Offered (Publisher) and Requested (Subscriber) QoS policies.*

| No. | Identifier | QoS Conflict Condition (Violation) | Dependency | Entity | Basis |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 21 | PART ↔ PART | $[Writer.PART \cap Reader.PART] = \emptyset$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |
| 22 | RELIAB ↔ RELIAB | $[Writer.RELIAB < Reader.RELIAB]$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |
| 23 | DURABL ↔ DURABL | $[Writer.DURABL < Reader.DURABL]$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |
| 24 | DEADLN ↔ DEADLN | $[Writer.DEADLN.period > Reader.DEADLN.period]$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |
| 25 | LIVENS ↔ LIVENS | $[W.LIVENS < R.LIVENS] \vee [W.lease > R.lease]$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |
| 26 | OWNST ↔ OWNST | $[Writer.OWNST \neq Reader.OWNST]$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |
| 27 | DESTORD ↔ DESTORD | $[Writer.DESTORD < Reader.DESTORD]$ | Structural | Pub ↔ Sub | STD |

!!! tip "Characteristics of Standard Rules"
    Standard rules are strictly enforced by the ROS 2 Middleware (RMW) layer. Violating Stage 2 rules (RxO) will trigger an **`Incompatible QoS`** event, preventing the establishment of the connection between a Publisher and a Subscriber.
